# Python_chatbot
In this reposatory a python chatbot is created with two approaches:
## 1. Retrieval based Chat bots:
A retrieval-based chatbot uses predefined input patterns and responses. It then uses some type of heuristic approach to select the appropriate response. It is widely used in the industry to make goal-oriented chatbots where we can customize the tone and flow of the chatbot to drive our customers with the best experience.

The Retrival based chatbots are in the folder "Retrieval based chatbots"

## 2. Generative based Chat bots:
Generative models are not based on some predefined responses.
They are based on seq 2 seq neural networks. It is the same idea as machine translation. In machine translation, we translate the source code from one language to another language but here, we are going to transform input into an output. It needs a large amount of data and it is based on Deep Neural networks.

The generative chatbots codes are in the folder "generative based chatbots"
